## Abstract

Modern AI faces **structural limitations** due to massive GPU computation and high energy consumption.  
This study introduces the **Planaria Project**, a **human-AI collaborative research framework**,  
leveraging a **Multi-Agent Consensus Model** combined with a **Dynamic Threshold Gating (DTG)** algorithm  
within **Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)** to overcome these limitations.

Experiments using a single LIF neuron demonstrated that dynamic control of spiking thresholds  
led to a maximum of **143 spikes**, suggesting up to **95% potential energy savings** compared to GPU-based computation.  
This research provides strong evidence that **AI can act not just as a tool, but as an active scientific contributor**,  
offering a **new paradigm for sustainable AI architectures**.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background
- Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 have achieved breakthroughs in language understanding and reasoning.  
- However, single training runs involve **tens of billions of parameters**, consuming energy comparable to  
  **an entire small city's annual electricity usage**.
- These computational demands severely limit AI's scalability to **IoT devices, robotics, autonomous systems**, and beyond.

### 1.2 Motivation
- The human brain performs **real-time computation** with **~86 billion neurons** using just **20W of power**.
- Inspired by this efficiency, **event-driven Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)** provide a path toward  
  **low-power, real-time, and sustainable AI computation**.

### 1.3 Research Questions
- Can AI achieve **human-level intelligence** at **ultra-low energy consumption**?
- Can AI become a **scientific co-author**, not just a passive tool?

### 2.2 Dynamic Threshold Gating (DTG)
- Based on the **Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF)** neuron model.
- Threshold function:  
  \[
  V_{th}(t) = V_{th,base} \cdot e^{-\alpha t}
  \]
- Parameters:
    - \( V_{th,base} \): Initial spike threshold  
    - \( \alpha \): Threshold decay rate  
    - \( t \): Time
