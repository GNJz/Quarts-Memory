## Abstract

Modern AI faces structural limitations due to massive GPU computation and high energy consumption.  
This study, conducted under the **Planaria Project**, proposes a novel scientific methodology through  
**human-AI collaborative research**.

We introduce a synergy model combining **LLM (hypothesis generation)** and  
**SNN (hypothesis validation)** by applying a **Dynamic Threshold Gating** algorithm to  
Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) spiking neuron models.  
Using a **multi-agent consensus framework**, we performed cross-verification  
between AI agents assigned as experimentalists, reviewers, and innovators.

Results show that dynamic threshold modulation increased total spike counts by  
up to **143x** compared to fixed-threshold models, indicating significant potential for  
energy-efficient, real-time AI computation.  
This research demonstrates that AI can act as an **active scientific co-author**,  
laying the foundation for sustainable AI architectures.

## 1. Introduction

Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have expanded human  
cognitive capabilities but at the cost of **extremely high energy consumption**.  
State-of-the-art LLMs require hundreds of billions of parameters and consume  
energy comparable to that of a small city.  
This bottleneck restricts AI deployment in edge environments and  
poses sustainability challenges.

We propose a new paradigm based on **Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)**,  
inspired by the human brain's **ultra-efficient signaling**.  
Our approach integrates three key elements:

1. **Multi-Agent Consensus** — minimizes bias through diverse AI agent collaboration
2. **Dynamic Threshold Gating** — enables energy-efficient, real-time neuron sensitivity control
3. **Human-AI Joint Research** — combines human intuition with AI computation to accelerate discovery

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Multi-Agent Consensus Framework

| Role        | Agent  | Function                        |
|------------|--------|--------------------------------|
| Experimental Lead | Quartz | Modeling, simulation, data analysis |
| Conservative Reviewer | Gemini | Statistical validation, logical review |
| Neutral Meta Agent | GNJz | Research logs, version control |
| Innovation Catalyst | Groq | New algorithms, application scenarios |

### 2.2 Dynamic Threshold Gating

LIF neuron model equation:  
\[
\tau \frac{dV}{dt} = - (V - V_{rest}) + RI
\]

Dynamic threshold control:  
\[
V_{th}(t) = V_{th,base} \cdot e^{-\alpha t}
\]

- **Vth,base**: Initial firing threshold  
- **α**: Decay coefficient for dynamic sensitivity adjustment  
- **t**: Time  

This enables neurons to adaptively fire only when necessary,  
achieving significant energy savings.
